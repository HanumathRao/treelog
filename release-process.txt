1. Publish the scaladoc to gh-pages: sbt "doc make-site ghpages-push-site"
2. Publish to sonatype:
  For snapshots make sure the version number has a -SNAPHOT suffix. To release to staging, remove the suffix.
  In both cases use 'sbt publish'

  To actually release:
  (See section 8a https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-7b.StageExistingArtifacts)
  	  Do a staging release by removing the -SNAPSHOT in the version number
	  Login to the Nexus UI at https://oss.sonatype.org/
	  Under 'Build Promotion' select Staging Repositories.
	  Find our release item and click it
	  Click the Close button (next to the Refresh button)
	  Wait ...
      Keep checking the Activity tab to see if any rules failed.
